You are working on an existing School / Madrasa ERP system.
Follow instructions strictly.
Do not redesign UI.
Do not add new features.
Only refactor logic and remove wrong sections.

GOAL:
Remove “মারহালা ফি অবস্থা” section from বেতন ব্যবস্থাপনা
and make Fee Setup the ONLY source of marhala fee & fee status.

========================
1️⃣ SALARY / PAYMENT MANAGEMENT (IMPORTANT)
========================

In বেতন ব্যবস্থাপনা page:

❌ Completely REMOVE the following:
- “মারহালা ফি অবস্থা” section
- Monthly fee display inside payment page
- Fee status card or summary
- Any fee amount coming from here

✅ This page should ONLY:
- List students
- Show payment button
- Show paid amount / due amount (derived)
- Allow payment entry
- Generate receipt

⚠️ Payment page must NOT define or control fee amount.

========================
2️⃣ FEE SETUP (SINGLE SOURCE)
========================

Fee Setup module is the ONLY place to define:

• Marhala / Class
• Monthly Fee
• Admission Fee
• Exam Fee
• Active / Inactive
• Academic Year

Each Marhala must have one active fee configuration.

========================
3️⃣ AUTO FEE STATUS CALCULATION
========================

Fee status must be calculated dynamically using:

• Student’s Marhala
• Active Fee Setup
• Total Paid Amount

Rules:
- Paid = 0 → Due
- Paid < Monthly Fee → Partial
- Paid >= Monthly Fee → Paid

❌ No manual status update
❌ No fee status stored in payment table

========================
4️⃣ DATA FLOW RULE (STRICT)
========================

Student → Marhala  
Marhala → Fee Setup  
Fee Setup → Monthly Fee  
Payment → Updates paid amount  
Fee Status → Derived (Not stored)

========================
5️⃣ UI DISPLAY RULE
========================

Fee Status may be DISPLAYED in:
• Student list
• Due list
• Reports
• Dashboard

But can NEVER be edited manually.

========================
6️⃣ DATABASE CLEANUP
========================

• Remove marhala_fee_status field from salary/payment related tables
• Do not duplicate fee amount in payment records
• Keep Fee Setup as source of truth

========================
7️⃣ DO NOT
========================

❌ Do not change sidebar menu
❌ Do not rename Bengali labels
❌ Do not add extra cards or charts
❌ Do not break existing data

========================
8️⃣ FINAL CHECK
========================

✔ No “মারহালা ফি অবস্থা” visible in payment page
✔ Fee always comes from Fee Setup
✔ Payment page is clean & simple
✔ Logic matches Madrasa monthly workflow

After implementation:
Briefly explain what was removed and what logic was refactored.
